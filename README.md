### COMP90024 Project 2: Negative Sentiment Analysis Based on Tweets in Australia

This is the Project 2 for COMP90024 (Cluster and Cloud Computing) from the University of Melbourne.

The goal of this project is to harvest tweets from across the cities of Australia on the [UniMelb Research Cloud](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/infrastructure/research-platform-services/services/research-cloud) and undertake a variety of data analytics scenarios that tell interesting stories of life in Australian cities related to one or more [deadly sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins) and importantly how the Twitter and precollected Instagram data can be used alongside/compared with/augment the data available within the [AURIN](https://aurin.org.au/) platform to assess/validate these sins.

For more details, please check the [project specifications](https://github.com/Andy-TK/COMP90024_Project2/blob/master/project%20specifications.pdf) and [project report](https://github.com/Andy-TK/COMP90024_Project2/blob/master/CCC-Team35-Report.pdf).

### 1. The Architecture and Website Demo

In this project, four virtual machines (Ubuntu) were built on the [Nectar](https://nectar.org.au/) cloud platform, three of which deployed [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) distributed databases and one deployed the [Flask](http://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)-based Web backend, using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for automated deployment. Climb the Tweets posted in Australia over a period of time, store them into CouchDB, use the relevant Python libraries for sentiment analysis, and visualize the front end of the results.
