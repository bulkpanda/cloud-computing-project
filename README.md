This is the Assignment 2 for COMP90024 (Cluster and Cloud Computing) from the University of Melbourne.

The	goal of this project is to develop a	Cloud-based	solution	that	exploits	virtual	machines	(VMs)	on the	UniMelb Research	Cloud	for	harvesting	and	processing	Mastodon	toots.	The	teams	should	produce	a	solution that	can	be	run	(in	principle)	across	any	node	of	 the	UniMelb Research	Cloud	 to	harvest	and	store	social	 media data and	 scale	 up/down	 as	 required with	 the	 data	 being	 harvested,	 processed	 and incorporated	into	the	existing (running) CouchDB	database.

### 1. The Architecture and Website Demo

In this project, six virtual machines (Ubuntu) were built on the [Nectar](https://nectar.org.au/) cloud platform, three of which deployed [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) clusters, one with backup server, one deployed the mastodon harvesters using ansible for automated deployment and one deployed dashboard via R shiny. Toots are collected from harvesters, python libraries are used for sentiment and profanity analysis, the processed data is then stored at the couchDB cluster, views are created to get relevant information from the database and the dashboard then visualises the results.

### 2. Some Relevant Technology Stacks

* **WebServer** - webserver built by [Rshiny](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/shiny/versions/1.7.4)
* **Automation** - [Ansible playbook](https://www.ansible.com/)
* **Harvest** - Setting up mastodon harvesters
* **CouchDB** - [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) cluster and [Map-Reduce](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/ddocs/views/intro.html)
* **Data Analysis** - a _Python module_ [vaderSentiment](https://vadersentiment.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for sentiment analysis
* **Data Visualization** - Plotly, leaflet, ggplot2
* **Website** - Based on R shiny.
